# image_compression_SVD
image compression using Singular value decomposition in R.
This project uses Singular Value Decomposition to compress grayscale and color images in R
The pdf file "finalsvd.pdf" is create using R markdown and contains all information regarding the project. It conatins both 
grayscale and color images compression.
The separate R code for grayscale compression and color compression is present in the files "grayscale_compression.R" and 
"color_compression.R" respectively.
The images '5_vectors.png','10_vectors.png','25_vectors.png' are grayscale compressions of original image 'flower.jpg'
The images 'red.jpg','green.jpg','blue.jpg' are RGB images of the original image 'flower.jpg' and are created from the file
'color_compression.R'.
To run the R code in "color_compression.R" and "grayscale_compression.R", you will need R libraries "imager","jpeg".
The final conclusion and summary of whole project is included in "finalsvd.rmd". You will need to knit the markdown file to 
obtain final pdf file "finalsvd.pdf"
